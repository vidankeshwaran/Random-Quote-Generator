### Treehouse Techdegree Project #1 - Random Quote Generator

In this project, We'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You can display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure:

"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

We'll need to use our knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, including variables, loops and object literals, to complete this project.

This project is a fun and effective way for us to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. It also gives us a simple interactive portfolio piece to show off our understanding of JavaScript.

# Appraiser Comments
Awesome work, Vidankeshwaran! Your project looks great and after seeing so many of these, I appreciate you changing the styling up.

Nice job ensuring that your function returns the entire quote object and then adding in those extra features! I added a hint in the individual rubric if you want to try creating a non-repeating randomizer.

You're ready to move on to the next project and get further into JavaScript. Have fun!

Thanks for being an Elysium student.
